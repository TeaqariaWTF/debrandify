DeWordPressify is an extension for WordPress that lets you hide all of WordPress' branding, from the logo on the login page to mentions of it in the dashboard or in emails. You can replace it with your company's branding and make your site look entirely your own.

DeWordPressify also has some advanced functions that let you easily disable built-in features of WordPress you might not be using, like comments, emojis, RSS feed and more, thus making your site lighter.

### How to install DeWordPressify with custom default settings

You might want to install DeWordPressify on multiple websites without having to customise your settings on every single one of them. If so, there is an easy way!

1. Get ahold of the DeWordPressify plugin. You can either download a release from this repo or simply get it from the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder on a website where it's already installed.
2. Once you have the plugin, navigate to `/src/php/` in it and open the `functions.php` file.
3. The first thing you'll see should be the `getDefaultOptions()` function. This is where default options are defined, each line corresponding to a toggle/field of the DeWordPressify settings page.
4. Simply edit each line you want customised, `'yes'` being toggled and `'no'` being untoggled. 
5. Save the file and upload the plugin to your new site (either zip it and upload it through the WordPress dashboard, or put it in the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder)
6. Activate it and that's it! DeWordPressify should be initialised with your custom settings.
