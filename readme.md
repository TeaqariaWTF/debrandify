DeWordPressify is an extension for WordPress that lets you hide all of WordPress' branding, from the logo on the login page to mentions of it in the dashboard or in emails. You can replace it with your company's branding and make your site look entirely your own.

DeWordPressify also has some advanced functions that let you easily disable built-in features of WordPress you might not be using, like comments, emojis, RSS feed and more, thus making your site lighter.
